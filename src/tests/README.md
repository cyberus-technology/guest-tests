# Guest Tests

Every sub-folder contains the files for a small test kernel that tests a specific
and isolated aspect of the hardware, just like an operating system would use it.

## `properties.toml` files

The `properties.toml` file next to each test contains a subset of the meta
attributes of that test. Please refer to the [top-level README](/README.md) for
further explanation.
