# Contributing

We are happy for bug reports, fix suggestions, and pull requests. However,
at the moment, this repository is meant as read-only mirror of our internal
project. If you submit PRs, we may cherry-pick them and add them internally to
our regular pipeline.

Once the contribution volume on this mirror reaches a significant threshold, we
may change our development model.
